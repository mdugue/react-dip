## Why?

Ever wanted to implement one of those incredible designs you find on [dribble](http://dribbble.com/) or [Muzli](https://muz.li/) where one element beautifully transforms into another upon page transition? And then realized _"But I want my code to stay statefull, decoupled, scalable, declarative"_, so you ended up with regular "hard cuts" instead? ‚Äì **To me this happend very very often!**

`react-dip` solves this by providing animated transisions in an effortless way, that _just works<sup>TM</sup>_, by using the [FLIP technique](https://aerotwist.com/blog/flip-your-animations/#the-general-approach).

## Installation

Using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
$ yarn add react-dip

# or using npm
$ npm install --save react-dip
```

Using a module bundler like [webpack](webpack.js.org) or [parcel](https://parceljs.org/), import your depency just as any other:

```javascript
// Using ES6 modules
import Dip from 'react-dip'

// or using CommonJS modules
var Dip = require('react-dip')
```

UMD builds are also available via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dip/dist/react-dip.umd.min.js" />
```

## Quick Start

The API is as small as possible, almost everything is optional, so you see results immediately. Just wrap your Items in a `Dip`

```jsx
import React, {Component} from 'react'
import Dip from 'react-dip'

function Component1() {
  return (
    <Dip dipId="quickStart" style={{background: 'red'}}>
      some content
    </Dip>
  )
}

function Component2() {
  return (
    <Dip
      dipId="quickStart"
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: '100px', background: 'green'}}
    >
      some other content <br />
      etc...
    </Dip>
  )
}

// use complex state here
// or a routing solution such as react-router
// or connect it to redux, or ustated
export default class MyStatefulParent extends Component {
  state = {currentStep: 0}
  toggleState = () =>
    this.setState(state => ({
      currentStep: (state.currentStep + 1) % 2,
    }))
  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <h1> Quick Start example </h1>
        <button onClick={this.toggleState}>toggle me</button>
        {this.state.currentStep === 0 ? <Component1 /> : <Component2 />}
      </section>
    )
  }
}
```

_Note: Using `inline styles` as well as `absolute` positioning is usually not considered a good way and is applied here for the sake of simplicity.
You can use any type `CSS` or `CSS-in-JS` styling and `fluid` / `flex` / `grid` layout._

## Props

The API surface is intetended to be as simple as possible. Only `dipId` and `children` (or `render`) are required props. The rest is optional and helps you fine tuning your animations.

### dipId

> `string` | **Required!**

The `id` that groups two different dip elements. React-dip will only create animated transitions between to Elements with the same `dipId`, consider them as potential _from_- and _to_-hints.

### children

> `React Element` | **Required unless using `render`-prop!**

Content that is rendered as part of that `Dip`.

### render

> `function({ref: function(), styles: {}})` | **Required unless using `children`-prop!**

Function that should return the content that is rendered as part of that `Dip`. Allows for more advanced pattern and skips the wrapping Element. See [render prop](https://cdb.reacttraining.com/use-a-render-prop-50de598f11ce) for further details.

**Warning:** `<Dip render>` takes precedence over `<Dip children>` so don‚Äôt use both in the same `<Dip />`.

### duration

> `number` | _**optional**_, defaults to `200`

Time in milliseconds the animation will take when transitioning _to_ this dip.

### easing

> `string` | _**optional**_, defaults to `"ease-out"`

Specifies the desired timing function. Accepts the pre-defined values `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, and `ease-in-out`, or a custom `cubic-bezier` value like `cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1)`.

### element

> `string` | _**optional**_, defaults to `"div"`

Specify the desired HTML-tag here (eg. `<Dip element="li">`) in case you don't want your children wrapped in a `div`.

### optInCssStyles

> `Array(string)` | _**optional**_, defaults to an empty `array`

By default `react-dip` will morph your components _only_ regarding their sizes and positions using `css transforms` which is usually a good default regarding performance.
In case you want to morph more css properties you can specify them here, such as `optInCssStyles={["borderRadius", "backgroundColor"]}`. _**optional**_

### className, id, style, aria-..., role, etc.

> default `react` / `HTML attributes` | _**optional**_

Any provided standard attribute is passed to the child-container.

## Polyfill

As some browsers do not support the [Web Animations API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=web-animation), we recommend using the [web-animations-js Polyfill](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js).

1.  Install the dependency

```bash
$ yarn add web-animations-js

# or using npm
$ npm install --save web-animations-js
```

2.  include the dependency into your project.

```javascript
import('web-animations-js') // We recommend dynamic imports to keep initial bundlesize small
```

## Dip-WHAT???

No _DEEEE-EYE-PEEE_, just **dip** your taco into some tasty salsa. üåÆ

## How it works (TODO)

* Dip-Communication, dipId, from & to
* FLIP

## Browser Compatiblity

| Chrome | Firefox | Safari          | Edge            | IE              | iOS             |
| ------ | ------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ<sup>\*</sup> | ‚úÖ<sup>\*</sup> | ‚úÖ<sup>\*</sup> | ‚úÖ<sup>\*</sup> |

<sup>\*</sup> [(requires polyfill)](#polyfill)

## Caveats (TODO)

* Block-Elements h1 etc
* nested Elements
* transitioning to elements in scrolled lists (via browser back)
* text can get distorted

## Inspired by

* https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-move

## Huge Thanks to

* [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds/) for his inspiring work, such as [kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts)
* [Ives van Horne](https://github.com/compuives) amongst other for [CodeSandbox](codesandbox.io)

## TODOs

There are tons of ideas for improving `react-dip` such as adding fine grained control to your transitions, but the primary goal will stay to keep the API as symple as possible.

### To be done before anouncing

* [x] add chapter about polyfilling
* [x] render props (of course)
* [x] add support for custom timing functions
* [ ] add complex examples with renderProps, routing etc.
* [ ] add possibility of declaring alternative components that are shown whilst animating
* [ ] export types for flow and typescript
* [ ] add contributing guide lines
* [x] add error handling for props
* [ ] add error handling for refs
* [x] move animation to portal, allowing for parents with `overflow: hidden` and avoiding z-index issues

### For some near future milestone

* [ ] add support for staggering
* [ ] add real tests
* [ ] export types for flowtyped and typescript
* [ ] add optional placeholder component that is shown whilst animating
* [ ] add documentation, (maybe even abstractions) for image transitions from low-res to high-res
